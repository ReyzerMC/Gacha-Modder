# Gacha-Modder
a tool to make it easier to manage mods for Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Wuthering Waves &amp; Zenless Zone Zero.

How to use:

1: Download the compressed file on releases.
2: Open the compressed file and unzip it wherever you want the application.
3: (Only in some cases) Add the application to the exclusion list of your antivirus, 
whether it is the default Windows antivirus or another (I don't know why some antivirus detect it as malicious. Example: McAfee)
4: Run the application and select the game you prefer (You can use all 4 at the same time)
5: Go to the section that says config and set the path where you have the mods for that game
6: And that would be all to disable any mod click on "Disable" or right click -> disable on a mod after selecting it and to enable it again do the same but on the other side
